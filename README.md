### Description
This is PHASE_2 for NETMO. The name has been change from "NETMOS" to "NETMO" to be even more complex and unique. "NETMO" comes from COSMO, which is the Greek Lettering for COSMOS, which is another name for the cosmos flower. 

For PHASE_2, bootstrap will added to PHASE_1 original adaptations. 

The next step afterwards, is to compile research on other automation softwares to use for PHASE_2. I am unsure if Netmiko will be able to withstand the more complex network configurations. 

These are things that I wish to include in PHASE_2(Subject to Change): 
    - Speed Policy Changes
    - Trunking & Access Port Interface Creation 
    - Shut no shut commands 
    - Adding IP Address 
    - Configure VLAN 
    - Exit Interface Static Route
    - Fully-specified route 
    - IP Default-Gateway
    - Routing Information Protocol (RIPv2)
    - Staic Port Security 
    - show ip int brief
    - show ip route
    - show run 
    - show vlan brief 
    
A CSV File, with Text files will be used for data collection and to collect and monitor. 

One final thing that I wanted to implement is a monitoring system. Optional tasks. Meant for PHASE_3, but would be ideal if it is accomplished in PHASE_2. Setup for a good PHASE_3.
