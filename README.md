# PHASE_2
<h1 align=center>NESMOS</h1>

<h2 align=center>Nathan Rampersaud</h2>

This is PHASE_2 for NESMOS. The name has been change from "NETMOS" to "NETMO" to be even more complex and unique. "NETMO" comes from COSMO, which is the Greek Lettering for COSMOS, which is another name for the cosmos flower. 

For PHASE_2, bootstrap will added to PHASE_1 original adaptations. 


The next step afterwards, is to compile research on other automation softwares to use for PHASE_2. I am unsure if Netmiko will be able to withstand the more complex network configurations. 


These are things that I wish to include in PHASE_2(Subject to Change):

``` 
     1. Speed Policy Changes
     2. Trunking & Access Port Interface Creation 
     3. Shut no shut commands 
     4. Adding IP Address 
     5. Configure VLAN 
     6. Exit Interface Static Route
     7. Fully-specified route 
     8. IP Default-Gateway
     9. Routing Information Protocol (RIPv2)
     10. Static Port Security 
     11. show ip int brief
     12. show ip route
     13. show run 
     14. show vlan brief 
     **Upload .txt and .csv files
```


A CSV File, with Text files will be used for data collection and to collect and monitor. 

One final thing that I wanted to implement is a monitoring system. Optional task. Meant for PHASE_3, but would be ideal if it is accomplished in PHASE_2. Setup for a good PHASE_3. 

Final Notes: 

This is a very very close finalized product for PHASE_2. Most of the main functionalities are done which indicate an ability to accomplish the users tasks. However, more work needs to be done to improve the frontend capalities of the web application. It needs to be pleasing to the eye to look at, very simple to navigate, unique, and images for user use need to be included. These are to certify a proper MVP. The time is also here... Commence the preliminary start of PHASE_3
